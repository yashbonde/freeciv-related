    "For this iteration I am trying to connect to the freeciv-desktop server running locally on my machine. This notebook is written to establish rules for connection and how to work further in establishing the communication side. Once this part is established we can proceed to using of information and then eventual deep learning support. This also happens to be the first step and thus the name `1_Connection.ipynb`\n",

In another implementation for connecting to freeciv server that I read `tornado` was used to communicate, though that might have handled the job well, this thing is very new to me. I am starting by using sockets, which is what is used to connect two nodes. One node listens to a particular IP and node while the other node sends out information to connect to the node.\n",
