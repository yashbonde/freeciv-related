# BhishmNet

This is a folder with all the versions of world's first Full Information Neural Network (FINN) Models designed to play in [pyfc](https://github.com/yashbonde/freeciv-python). Unlike previous versions such as this, were not FINN because they used prior information (game manual) to play the game. While BhishmNet learns to play the game by it's own.

## Versions

The versions of the network are as follows:

### [VERSION 0](https://github.com/yashbonde/freeciv-related/tree/master/BhishmNet/v0)

This is the first implementation to see how the network plays and how is the response of `pyfc`. I started to make this when the structure of pyfc was finalised and we needed to see from the perspective of the developer what are the functionalities that are needed.
