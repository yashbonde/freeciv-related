# Sample Package Templates

Each file here is a richly documented temaplate to make ease of use and development a priority, in that particular order. We aim to develop a package which can be used by adavenced user as well as layman with equal use.

## Steps

Look at the idea [here](https://github.com/yashbonde/freeciv-python/blob/master/ex_images/freeciv_steps-02.png) which shows the step-by-step idea of how the package will work.

NOTE: This is still the proposed structure and not the final iteration

## Stucture of Files

The structure of freeciv package is relatively simple, the freeciv folder has the templates for the backend functions.

For more details go in each folder.
